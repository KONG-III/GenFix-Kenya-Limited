                        <p>
                            Genfix Kenya Limited is a Kenyan company established in 2013 and registered under the Companies Act.We are stockiest of Generators, Servicing and maintenance, Solar panels, all types of Water Heaters, Street Lighting, Automatic Control systems and Electrical Services.
                            In the time that we have been in business, we have increased our sales and customer base tremendously. 
                            Our organisation was founded in the belief that it could play a significant role in Kenya's
                            development into the new Millennium.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With that vision as a guide, the company began from humble beginnings with a few casual workers to more than 50 fulltime employees.Through their dilligent work and professionalism the company has rapidly grown and diversified from residential clients to include Corporate Clients.
                            Currently, our market footprint covers Nairobi and most parts of Kenya.These clients act as our referees on the quality, efficiency and reliability of the work that we do. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            One of the strategies that we have employed to ensure that we pass on the benefits of high quality and
                            reasonable costs to our customers is to move from buying materials from local wholesalers to importing them directly from the manufacturing companies.
                            Our objective is to present our clients with a snapshot of Genfix Kenya Limited for their review and subsequent consideration as a reliable business partner.
